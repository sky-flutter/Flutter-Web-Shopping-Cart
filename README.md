# Shopping Cart Web App in flutter

This is my first endeavor to create a web app in flutter with dart.
In screenshot folder, i have added some image of what i have created.
In this repo, I had created a design template only, no business logic or network calling implemented. Simply create a navbar menu and on tap on it redirect and create a design which response as per the device resolution.

# Build andÂ deploy:

For a build web app, use this command: webdev build
This command is used to building a web means it generates a build folder and this folder will be used for the deployment. If you want to test that this will work or not simply follow the below step(Only for windows).
<ul>
  <li>Search Turn windows feature on or off in windows</li>
  <li>Then checked IIS (Internet Information Service)</li>
  <li>Search IIS and open it</li>
  <li>In Connection Section, You can see sites</li>
  <li>Right-click on sites and add website</li>
  <li>Add Site name, set physical path of your build folder to generate above</li>
  <li>Assign any IP address and click OK</li>
  <li>In the Actions section, you can found browse the website.</li>
</ul>

You have successfully done the web deployment.
If you want to deploy on web hosting simply you need to upload the build folder on the hosting server.
